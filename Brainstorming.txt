-Siblings as potential instrument. 
In a frictionless world, asset availability has no impact on college admission choice; it merely changes debt vs. equity financing.
However, families with more children will have assets split between multiple siblings.
Therefore, ceteris paribus, students with more siblings will require more debt to attend college.
Thus, could regress final wage using siblings as an instrument for debt.

Potential problems:
-Differences between older/younger siblings. Could only look at firstborn children.
-Students with fewer siblings could get other types of parental investment, leading to other boots. EG extracurriculars.
