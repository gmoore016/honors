  abstract = {In the early 2000s, a highly selective university introduced a ``no-loans'' policy under which the loan component of financial aid awards was replaced with grants. We use this natural experiment to identify the causal effect of student debt on employment outcomes. In the standard life-cycle model, young people make optimal educational investment decisions if they are able to finance these investments by borrowing against future earnings; the presence of debt has only income effects on investment decisions. We find that debt causes graduates to choose substantially higher-salary jobs and reduces the probability that students choose low-paid ``public interest'' jobs. We also find some evidence that debt affects students' academic decisions during college. Our estimates suggest that recent college graduates are not life-cycle agents. Two potential explanations are that young workers are credit constrained or that they are averse to holding debt. We find suggestive evidence that debt reduces students' donations to the institution in the years after they graduate and increases the likelihood that a graduate will default on a pledge made during her senior year; we argue this result is more likely consistent with credit constraints than with debt aversion.},

  doi = {10.1016/0167-4870(96)80014-6},
  abstract = {Levels of debt and attitudes towards debt were investigated in a sample of undergraduate students. Students were found to be a relatively low-income, high-debt group with relatively tolerant attitudes towards debt. Some of the variables that have been found to be associated with debt in general public samples were also found to have significant effects in the student group: these included religion, age, number of credit cards used, and more tolerant attitudes towards debt. In addition, men were more likely to be in debt than women. Variables correlated with tolerant attitudes towards debt included age, some kinds of expenditure, religion, and external locus of control. A pseudo-longitudinal design was used to examine the relationship between attitudes and debt: cohort (year of study) was taken as a proxy for time. Higher levels of debt, and greater tolerance of debt, were found in students who had been at university longer. The increase in debt occurred earlier in students' careers than the increase in tolerance towards debt. The results are interpreted in terms of a life cycle theory of economic behaviour, and a behavioural theory of attitude change. Students come from relatively prosperous socioeconomic groups but have low incomes which they perceive as temporary; to sustain their expected life style, they have to accept some level of debt. Their attitudes then adjust towards tolerance of debt so as to ensure consistency.},

  abstract = {The validity of family background variables instrumenting education in income regressions has been much criticized. In this paper, we use data from the 2004 German Socio-Economic Panel and Bayesian analysis to analyze to what degree violations of the strict validity assumption affect the estimation results. We show that, in case of moderate direct effects of the instrument on the dependent variable, the results do not deviate much from the benchmark case of no such effect (perfect validity of the instrument's exclusion restriction). In many cases, the size of the bias is smaller than the width of the 95\% posterior interval for the effect of education on income. Thus, a violation of the strict validity assumption does not necessarily lead to results which are strongly different from those of the strict validity case. This finding provides confidence in the use of family background variables as instruments in income regressions.},
