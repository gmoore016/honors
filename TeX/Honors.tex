	\section*{Abstract}
	
	In the summer of 2007, the Higher Education Reconciliation Act (or HERA) expanded the cap for federally subsidized student loans. To evaluate the impact of this shift on student career outcomes, I use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child and Young Adult Cohort of students who were of college age when the policy was implemented. I compare both career choice and eventual salary of those granted the additional credit line to those of the students before the shift to calculate estimates of the effects. I find that student debt appears to have no impact on salary two years after graduation; however, it does seem to shift students' career choices, leading students to avoid careers in public service industries such as teaching and social work.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	From 2000 to 2015, total undergraduate enrollment rose by 30\% from 13.2 to 17 million students \parencite{mcfarland2017}. Meanwhile, the real quantity of outstanding student debt tripled from \$340 billion to more than \$1.3 trillion over the same period \parencite{feiveson2018}.
	
	Traditional models of investment would suggest financing methodology would not change consumer behavior--for a given student, in the absence of credit constraints, whether they finance their education with debt or existing capital would not change their consumption decisions. However, empirically this is not the case. A survey by Nellie Mae suggests that one in six loan recipients have changed their career plans due to their debt obligation, though how those plans changed was not specified in the survey \parencite{baum2003}. This survey contained only those who had not yet defaulted on their debt; as defaulters were heavily affected by debt, the true number is likely greater. \textcite{minicozzi2005} finds that men who take on more undergraduate debt take jobs with higher initial wages but lower year-over-year wage growth, again suggesting a real impact of what should be a purely accounting-based change. 
	
	A debt subsidy could theoretically create an income effect, however even an extremely generous program promising zero interest on student debt would only increase students' income by around \$50 per year per thousand dollars borrowed--a fraction of the expected lifetime earnings of a college attendee. Thus, it is unlikely the income effect from this subsidy would be able to explain any of the behavior outlined above.
	
	An alternate explanation as to why debt would change students' behavior is that students may be ``debt averse,'' meaning that the act of holding debt has a negative impact on students' utility independent of any impact that debt may have on later consumption. This would cause students to pay off debt more quickly than would be efficient, ``consuming'' through paying off debt ahead of schedule. Students who are minorities, low-income, or first generation are especially susceptible to this phenomenon \parencite{burdman2005, field2009, callender2005}. 
	
	One frequent explanation for this phenomenon is risk aversion. Given student debt is uniquely difficult to disperse, the consequences for default can be catastrophic. Thus, as students take on more debt, they risk failing to pay back their loans. It is rational, then, to gravitate to higher paying, more stable careers which could bring a lower risk of insolvency. 
	
	The most relevant study on debt aversion is by \textcite{field2009}. In her experiment, New York University law students were randomly assigned either loan- or grant-based aid. The students assigned loans were told that their debt would be forgiven upon entry into a public service sector. Similarly, students given grants were told that, if they did \emph{not} enter the public service sector, they would be obligated to repay their grants. The two programs were designed to be financially identical--they differed only in the framing of whether the student was ``in debt.'' However, the author found that the students who were given the debt-based aid were significantly more likely to choose the high-wage, non-public-service position than their counterparts receiving grant-based aid. Given the aid packages are financially identical, the authors conclude this likely derives from some negative socio-psychological impact of carrying debt.
	
	In an ideal world, we could answer the question of debt and employment through regressing some measure of career choice on debt level. However, endogeneity issues make this solution infeasible. Given students choose to take debt based on expectations of their future earnings, there exists a reverse-causal effect from career to debt. Therefore, we require some sort of random assignment or instrument in order to accurately infer causality. 
	
	The focus of this paper is to determine whether increases in debt lead students to change their fields of study and eventually career choices. While prior work in the literature has largely focused on policy changes within a single institution, I hope to create a more representative picture of the nation as a whole using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. In 2006, the United States raised the cap for Stafford Loans for freshmen and sophomores, creating a natural experiment wherein the students before the policy change were more limited in their access to debt than the students after the shift.
	
	I find that student debt has negligible impact on incomes two years after graduation. However, students with more student debt are significantly less likely to work in public service positions such as education and social work. These career choice findings are in line with \textcite{rothstein2011} who also find reduced engagement in public service sectors. Also in line with Rothstein and Rouse, I find this impact is not present in other sectors; student debt appears to have no impact on students' choices to enter finance, STEM, or the humanities. This appears to be in line with a model I propose where given a greater credit constraint, students substitute away from careers with non-monetary benefits towards those with a greater focus on remuneration. If those in public service receive some sort of non-monetary benefit from serving in an altruistic career, this shift in preference could negatively impact society utility as those positive externalities are lost when students migrate away from these public service fields.
	
	\section{Literature Review}
	
	The current central paper of the literature is \textcite{rothstein2011}, which uses the introduction of a ``no loans'' policy at prestigious private college ``Anon U''--implied to be Princeton University--as a natural experiment on the enrolled students. The authors use a function of expected family contribution as an instrument for the impact of the policy, discovering that an additional \$10,000 of student debt leads students to reduce employment in the non-profit and education sectors by 5.2\% and reduce employment in low-wage sectors generally by 5.7\%. This is further corroborated by an expected \$2,000 bump in wages per \$10,000 of debt. The authors also suggest increased debt shifts students towards more ``employable'' majors over what they describe as ``consumption'' majors. The main shortfall of this paper which I hope to correct is that Princeton students are not representative of the general population -- as of 2017, nearly 60\% of students at Princeton came from families in the top 10\% of Americans by income \parencite{aisch2017}. Other papers have examined similar phenomena in more specialized and similarly wealthy fields, finding that increased debt leads both dentists and lawyers to accept higher-paying jobs in disproportionately private practices \parencite{nicholson2015, field2009}.
	
	One suggestion for this form of behavior is a phenomenon called ``debt aversion,'' where borrowers are less inclined to take and carry debt than a traditional model would indicate. \textcite{burdman2005} finds many non-income factors can influence whether students choose to borrow to attend school. One of the most influential factors she found was parental attitudes towards loans, suggesting that students whose parents were debt averse were more likely to be debt averse themselves. \textcite{callender2005} find that low-income and minority students are significantly less likely to borrow, regardless of their field of study. However, \textcite{eckel2007} find that students who are debt averse are not significantly less likely to have borrowed to attend school, suggesting that we can expect to see debt aversion in our sample. 

	\section{Structural Model}

	I propose a model of career choice and loan repayment similar to that developed by \textcite{abraham2018}. Consider a two-stage consumption model. Individuals consume in period one entirely through borrowing against period two earnings, labeled as $B$. In period one agents choose to pursue a higher-paying career path $H$ or a lower-paying career path $L$. Consumption in period two is composed of two parts, less the quantity borrowed in period one. First, $C$, non-monetary utility from the chosen career path; consider the value of altruism for working in a non-profit or the value of expression for working as an artist. The second consumption parameter in time two is monetary salary, denoted $H$ and $L$ for the higher- and lower-paying careers respectively.
	
	Creditors are guaranteed to pay back their loan on career path $H$ due to their higher income. When taking career $L$, there is a risk $p$ of defaulting on your loan, in which case your monetary compensation for the period is reduced to zero, leaving only non-monetary compensation $C$. We assume that \emph{ceteris paribus} larger loans are more difficult to repay; thus, $p$ is a function increasing in $B$. Finally, there is some discount rate $r$ for the money borrowed in period one. This $r$ will favor the present, as we are examining interest-free loans for our students. This yields the following two utility functions for a risk-neutral consumer: 
	\begin{align}
	\mathbb{E}\left[U_H(B)\right] &= B + H - (1 - r)B \label{highu}\\
	\mathbb{E}\left[U_L(B)\right] &= B + C + p(B) \times L - (1 - r)B \label{lowu}
	\end{align}
	
	Note that students choosing career $L$ over career $H$ suggests that equation \ref{highu} is greater than equation \ref{lowu}. Some algebra yields the following equivalence relationship: 
	$$\mathbb{E}\left[U_L(B)\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[U_H(B)\right] > 0 \iff p(B) > \frac{H - C}{L} \label{choicecon}$$ 
	Thus, there are five factors that could shift students from $H$ to $L$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\singlespacing
		\item A decrease in $H$
		\item An increase in $C$
		\item An increase in $L$
		\item A change in the definition of $p$
		\item An increase in $B$, as $p'(B) < 0$
	\end{itemize}

	The above model is deterministic for any given student; given a fixed $H, C, L, p,$ and $B$ they will always choose the same career. Moreover, for simplicity, we allow $H, L$, and $p$ to be constant across all students, representing access to similar credit and labor markets. However, there exists idiosyncratic variation in $C$ between students; student $i$ may derive great utility from career $L$, while student $j$ may not care for $L$ at all.

	Note that for each student there exists some $B^*$ such that they are indifferent between $H$ and $L$. Suppose there exists some global upper bound on borrowing $\bar{B}$ which is binding for both those on career paths $H$ and $L$. When $\bar{B}$ is increased as in figure \ref{struc}, this will cause some--but not all--students to shift career from $L$ to $H$ as $\bar{B}$ may shift to be greater than $B^*$ for some subset of students. Given students before and after this change are comparable, we could treat this shift as a natural experiment, providing each student after the shift with an additional $\Delta\bar{B}$ debt burden. 
	
		
	\begin{figure}

		\caption{Illustration of Structural Model}
		\label{struc}
		\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{Images/ModelSketch}
	\end{figure}

	This model provides a concrete prediction regarding agents' behavior under a positive credit shock. In the absence of other factors, students who receive access to an increased line of credit should pivot \emph{away} from occupations with non-pecuniary benefits (those with higher $C$) towards those which are more lucrative. Depending on the context for $C$, this could have important consequences for a social planner; for example, if $C$ is some sort of ``warm glow'' effect from helping others, this could be net detrimental to society as those positive externalities are lost when students choose career $H$ over career $L$. 

	\section{HERA and Subsidized Student Loans}
	
	It is possible that there exists endogeneity between quantity of loans and career choices. For example, if a student anticipates a greater salary in the future, they would likely choose to take out more loans as undergraduates in order to smooth their consumption over time. In this case, there would exist a positive correlation between loans and salary, but the greater quantity of loans would not have caused the increase in salary. On the other hand, if students from lower income backgrounds take out more loans, but also have lower salaries for reasons unrelated to their educational spending such as weaker professional networks, this would cause loans to be negatively correlated with salary despite the loans not having caused the salary reduction. Among other mechanisms, these two examples demonstrate the endogeneity present in the relationship between loans and career outcomes. To correct for this endogeneity, I perform a two-stage least squares regression using a 2006 shift in federal loan policy to pseudo-randomly influence students' debt, mitigating the endogeneity problem. Assuming that students before and after the policy are comparable (an assumption I support in section 6), the students after the policy have received a roughly 20\% increase in subsidized loans from the federal government. Thus, by comparing these students to those before the policy, I can parse out the causal effects of these additional loans.
	
	I obtain exogenous variation in debt using the identification strategy from \textcite{lucca2018} who examine how increased Federal subsidized credit lines impact university tuition. In 2006, the Higher Education Reconciliation Act (HERA) increased subsidized borrowing caps for the first time in fourteen years. Freshmen received boosts from \$2,625 to \$3,500 per year, while sophomores received a greater boost from \$3,500 to \$4,500 per year. Caps for older students remained static at \$5,500. While HERA also increased the availability of unsubsidized credit, Lucca and his coauthors make a compelling argument that the increase in unsubsidized loan caps had a middling effect at best on uptake for unsubsidized loans. Students who increase unsubsidized borrowing under the program shift would have to meet two criteria: first, the students would have to be well off enough to not qualify for a wholly subsidized program, and second, the students still chose to take advantage of their whole program allowance. The authors find that fewer than 1\% of the students in their sample met both of these criteria.
	
	The act became effective during early summer 2007, meaning students had plenty of time to take advantage of the new rates before the fall semester. Thus, there is a clean break between the students with and without the lower credit limit moving from academic year 2006-07 and 2007-08.
	
	The authors also provide evidence that the subsidized loan cap had previously been binding. Figure \ref{luc} shows their histograms of student-level loan quantities before and after the HERA shift from the New York Fed/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel. Figure \ref{luc06} has a clear mode of \$2,625, the exact subsidized cap for freshmen pre-HERA, and a secondary mode of \$3,500, the subsidized cap for sophomores. Compare this with figure \ref{luc07}, which has modes at \$3,500 and \$4,500, the post-HERA caps for freshmen and sophomores, respectively. Further note that both graphs contain clusters at \$5,500, the constant cap for upperclass students, again suggesting the binding nature of the subsidized loan cap. 
	
	
	\section{Data}
	
	For my paper I use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth '79 Children and Young Adults, or NLSY79 CYA \parencite{bls2018}. A follow-up to the original National Longitudinal Survey of Youth '79, the CYA surveys the original respondents' children every other year from birth until the present day. Thus, we have respondents across the entire age spectrum during the implementation of the policy, allowing us to observe time-varying trends in debt acquisition and career choice. 
	
	The benefits of the CYA data over the Princeton data from \textcite{rothstein2011} are several. First, the NLSY is designed to focus on lower income households rather than Anon U's much wealthier sample. As visible in figure \ref{incDist}, 20\% of students come from households below the federal poverty line, as opposed to 10\% nationally. Second, the students in this survey attend a much broader range of colleges than those in the Rothstein data set. As the students who are accepted into prestigious universities such as Anon U are by definition selected, they \emph{cannot} be representative of the general American college-bound population. Third, the CYA surveys students both about their finances and about their career aspirations at each step of the process. Thus, not only can I track student outcomes after graduation, I am able to plot students' intentions over time, tracking variables such as intended major during their time at school. This provides a more interesting, nuanced panel as we can see how students' intentions evolve as their access to credit changes. Finally, with data from several different colleges, we can examine how college traits interact with student debt and career outcomes.

		\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{../Analysis/Charts/Output/parIncDist}
	\end{figure}
	
	One drawback of the CYA data set is that, as a survey, many of the figures are less precise than those in other sets. For example, when asked about their level of debt, the vast majority of responses are rounded numbers. While useful for qualitative analysis, this makes it difficult to assess data granularly as done by \textcite{lucca2018} in figure \ref{luc}. Fortunately, because they have a nationally representative dataset, there is no reason to believe their results would differ with our sample. Indeed, as our sample is of lower income relative to the general population, I would argue that subjects are bound more strongly by the policy as for many students federal loans may be their only option for college financing. In addition, as visible in figure \ref{loanDist}, we can see that 85\% of students received \$10,000 or less in debt, suggesting an additional \$1,000 would be meaningful relative to their overall quantity.

	\end{figure}

	
	Because of the connection between the CYA and original NLSY79, we can import very rich background information for each of our participants. Specifically, for each student we can identify parental income for the year in question among other background traits inherited from parents. We adjust all of these variables for inflation using the Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers \parencite{bls2019}. However, the drawback of being linked to the prior survey is that many of our observations are siblings, which would imply that they are not independently distributed if they share unobservable characteristics. To combat this issue, we will be clustering all standard errors based on the students' mothers. 
	
	Another difficulty with the NLSY sample is that certain questions are only asked in a more intensive form of the survey which is conducted on a subset of the sample every four years rather than every two. While the vast majority of our parameters are available for all subjects every other year, parental assets are only available in alternating years for roughly half the sample. I take two primary steps to rectify this. First, for those subjects who were surveyed about their assets, we extend the last known value into the missing year. For example, given asset data is missing in 2006, we use the subject's survey value for 2004. Second, for those parents with no existing asset data, we infer assets by performing the following regression on those whose asset data we do possess: $$\mbox{Assets} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mbox{Income} + \beta_2 \mbox{Income}^2 + \beta_3 \mbox{Age} + \beta_4 \mbox{Children} + \beta_5 \mbox{Year} + \vec{\beta} \vec{\mbox{Demographics}} + \epsilon$$ Since the subjects of the subsurvey were also chosen to be representative of the population, I feel comfortable that we are not extrapolating this data too far. I choose to let income be quadratic to reflect increasing marginal propensity to save among the wealthy. This regression yields the results visible in table \ref{assetTab}.
	
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\caption{Estimation of parental assets}
		\input{../Analysis/NeedCalc/Output/assethat.tex}
		\label{assetTab}
	\end{table}

	To ensure our policy shift is not being confounded with a shifting student body, we must ensure the composition of students in our sample is constant before and after the policy change in 2007. Fortunately, our samples before and after the policy change appear to be comparable across a variety of dimensions. The distributions of students before and after the policy change are visible by race in table \ref{racecomp}, sex in table \ref{sexcomp}, and region in table \ref{regioncomp}. Based on the $\chi^2$ values of these distributions, we can be relatively confident the composition of the student body before and after the treatment is comparable across these factors. In addition, I conduct a two-sample t-test comparing (inflation-adjusted) parental incomes across the groups. Before 2008, there are 271 observations with a mean parental income of \$67,945. From 2008 on there are 484 observations with a mean parental income of \$74,806. Testing whether the means of these two groups are the same yields a $t$-statistic of 1.40 ($p = 0.16$). Thus, we fail to reject the hypothesis real parental income in the sample remained constant before and after the policy shift.

	\section{Statistical Model}
	
	Our data set is a collection of seniors surveyed on even years between 2000 and 2014. If possible, we would hope to model some career outcome $Y$ according to the following equation: 
	\begin{equation}
	Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mbox{debt}_{it} + \vec{\xi}^T \vec{\mbox{demographics}}_i + \epsilon_{it} \label{naiveeq}
	\end{equation} 
	In this model, $Y$ could take one of several values, such as major choice, career choice, or salary. The results of this regression using several types of majors are separately visible in table \ref{naive2}. 
	
	\begin{table}
		\centering
		\caption{Results of the naive regression}
		\input{\regs naive.tex}
		\label{naive2}
	\end{table}
	
	Our first model will place major choice on the left hand side. I believe this to be the most novel outcome of interest, as few datasets have this level of resolution on their observations. Here I can place majors into several bins, and then run a probit regression on individual bins to determine the effect of the policy. The specifications of these bins can be found in the appendix, and we will adjust these bins later as a form of robustness  testing. The distribution of students broken down by major is visible in figure \ref{majDist}.

	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\caption{Breakdown of major in sample}
		\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{../Analysis/Charts/Output/majDist}
		\label{majDist}
	\end{figure}
	
	Our second model will be examining students' career outcomes. This is the outcome most widely researched in the literature, such as in \textcite{rothstein2011} and \textcite{field2009}. Similar to the regression above, this would use a series of probit models to examine whether increased debt pushes students into certain categories of career.
	
	Our final model will be directly examining students' final incomes. This is the most direct approach to measuring the impact of debt on choices; however, it may ignore factors such as career risk which would not be visible in simple income data.
	
	As outlined in section 4, it is likely there exists endogeneity between loans and career outcomes; therefore, we perform a two-stage least squares regression using exposure to the HERA credit increase as our instrumental variable in order to pseudo-randomly assign debt to our students. 
	
	We assume that outside of our random assignment, debt levels are dependent on parental resources, time trends, and demographic characteristics such as sex, race, and region of residence. As the time trend for debt levels may not be linear, we use dummies for each year to represent average debt within our sample for a given year. Further, we anticipate students taking out loans each semester; thus, those interviewed in the fall of their senior year would have less debt than those in the spring, so we include a semester dummy as well.
	
	The ideal first-stage model, then, would be: 
	\begin{equation}
	debt_i = \delta_0 + \delta_1 treatment_i + \delta_2 parIncome_i + \delta_3 fallSemester_i + \vec{\delta}^T i.year_i + \vec{\gamma}^T \vec{demographics}_i + \mu_i \label{fseq}
	\end{equation}
	
	There exist two primary problems with this approach, however. The first is that debt is inherently left-censored. While students who take loans display some positive value, those who choose not to borrow display zero when they instead potentially chose some ``negative'' through investing their assets rather than borrowing. 
	
	The solution to this issue is to perform the first stage regression using a Tobit model rather than traditional OLS, thus bounding predicted debt at zero. This creates problems of its own however, for using the fitted values as instruments would constitute one of Hausman's ``forbidden regressions.'' The Tobit is nonlinear, and therefore it is no longer guaranteed that these fitted values are uncorrelated with the structural residuals in equation \ref{naiveeq}. I use a method suggested by \textcite{angrist2009} to correct this issue. If my model is correct, then the values predicted in the above first stage model will strongly predict career outcomes in the second stage. Therefore, we can use the fitted values of the first stage as instruments for the second stage in a traditional Two Stage Least Squares model. By using a fitted linear model in the instrumenting stage, that is, the last stage, we obtain that structural residuals will be uncorrelated with the fitted values and covariates in the usual way. 
	
	The second difficulty this model faces is that it is difficult to determine which students are ``treated,'' as not all students observed after the policy change received the additional credit. Since subsidized loans are targeted at low-income families, only students whose anticipated need is greater than the existing cap were subject to this increased credit line. 
	
	Anticipated need is equal to students' tuition payments minus their expected family contribution, or EFC. While we cannot observe students' true EFC, we can calculate an approximation using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Then, using this approximation, we are able to generate a measure of need and so determine who is affected by the policy shift. We then generate a dummy $atCap$ equal to 1 if a student's need is greater than the old borrowing limit and so are in our sample. 
	
	As an initial test of my instrument, I regress loans on students' need and whether they are at the cap both before and after the policy shift. If my instrument is valid, we would expect students after the policy shift to experience greater increases in debt based on their level of need given they are at the previous cap for demonstrated need. The results of this initial regression are visible in columns (1) and (2) respectively of table \ref{firststage}. In this specification the coefficient for need above the cap appears more positive after the policy change than before, as expected. 
	
	In my more rigorous model, I perform a triple difference approach, interacting $atCap$ with students' need and policy shift. This allows me to use both students before the policy shift (who experience no policy impact) and students after the policy shift who are below the threshold (and thus have $atCap = 0$) as controls for our cohort of interest. Thus, my final model for the first stage is as follows: 
	\begin{align*}
	debt_i = \delta_0 &+ \delta_1 need + \delta_2 atCap + \delta_3 atCap \times need + \delta_4 policyImpact + \delta_5 atCap \times policyImpact\\
	 &+ \delta_6 policyImpact \times need + \delta_7 atCap \times policyImpact \times need + \delta_8 fallSemester \\
	 &+ \vec{\delta} i.year + \vec{\gamma} \vec{demographics}^T
	 \end{align*} 
	 
	 The results of this model are given in table \ref{firststage} with time and demographic effects omitted. Given our model is correct, our coefficient of interest is $\delta_7$, the impact of being in the treated cohort after the policy change in proportion to demonstrated need. An interpretation of each interaction coefficient is available in table \ref{coefInterp}.

	\section{Results}
	
	We will begin by estimating the likelihood of several types of careers. This will be done in the form of a probit model: either a student chooses to work in the relevant field, or they do not. Due to the nonlinearity of the tobit model used in the first stage, we use the estimates of debt from that equation as an instrument in this model (called $\hat{loan}$). The form of the regression is as follows: $$\mathbb{P}\left(major_i = majType\right) = \Phi\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{loan_i} + \beta_2 year + \vec{\beta}\vec{demographics}^T_i\right)$$
	
	The abbreviated results of these regressions are visible in table \ref{majChoice}. Bin definitions are borrowed from \textcite{rothstein2011}; specifications for which degrees are grouped into each bin are visible in table \ref{majGroups} in the appendix. Be aware that all regression tables in this section are shortened to the coefficients of interest; full results are available in the appendix. As consistent with Rothstein and Rouse's findings, students with more debt are less likely to choose a major in public service, in this case defined to be teaching or social work. These results are visible in regression (1). Also consistent with their findings, people are \emph{not} significantly more likely to go into more lucrative fields such as business, economics, engineering, or computer science, as visible in regressions (2) and (3).

	It is worth noting however that unlike Rothstein and Rouse, we find no impact wages, as visible in table \ref{incomeRes}. Regression (1) here performs a 2SLS regression examining the income of students two years after graduation. To test for differential effects at different income levels, I also run probits in regressions (2) and (3) to test whether loans can push people over certain thresholds, defined to be the 25th and 90th percentiles of income in our sample. These coefficients are also insignificant, suggesting that the effects present in the lower end of the distribution found by Rothstein and Rouse are not present in my sample.

	\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
	
	Contrary to the existing literature, I find no relationship between student debt and career income. However, reinforcing findings from other studies, I do find that students with debt are significantly less likely to enter public service industries such as teaching. Given these are occupations which traditionally provide positive externalities to their communities, I would describe this as a negative byproduct of higher education's focus on student loans for education financing. \textcite{abraham2018} suggest using income based repayment as a means of mitigating the risks of student loan default. Depending on the mechanism through which debt impacts students' choices, this could be an effective method for correcting this distortion.
